  eddy_detection.py    - Code for the detection of eddies
                         given a series of sea level maps

  eddy_tracking.py     - Code for the tracking of eddies 
                         after detection has been performed

  params.py            - Parameter file used by eddy detection
                         and eddy tracking programs

  eddy_census.py       - Code for calculating census statistics
                         of tracked eddies

  eddy_plot.py         - Code for plotting eddy tracks

  eddy_functions.py    - Module of supporting functions

 NOTES

  1. This code as been applied to model output from OFAM
     and from weekly and daily sea level maps from Aviso.
     To apply it to another dataset it is necessary to
     make the following adjustments:

     a. Add a new dataset id 'NAME' in the conditionals in
        params.py, including relevant parameters (number
        of time steps, resolution, time step).

     b. Add appropriate code in 'load_lonlat' and 'load_eta'
        functions (both in eddy_functions.py) to properly
        handle the loading of your data. Code assumes one
        file (spatial map) per time step.
